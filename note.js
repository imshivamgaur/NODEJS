// user-defined modules ==> module which are defined by the user

// in order to export a module, we have two ways
//! 1) module.exports = variableName; (using this we can only export one variable at a time)

//! 2) module.exports = {variableName1, variableName2}; (using this we can export multiple variables at a time)

//* for importing we have two ways
//? the syntax is ==> let variableName = require("path of the file");

//! let variableName = require("path");
//! let {vairalbeName1, variableName2, ...} = require("path"); F
